# Thyroid_Disease

* In the developed project, a dataset containing information about various symptoms is utilized to determine whether a patient has a specific thyroid gland-related issue. This dataset can be downloaded from the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository section and is available at the following address: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/102/thyroid+disease.

* This Big Data project aimed to process, prepare, and transform a dataset for the analysis and prediction of thyroid diseases. SparkSQL was used for data processing, and SparkMLlib facilitated the application of logistic regression and random forest classifier algorithms. Additionally, a Deep Learning approach utilizing TensorFlow was leveraged for disease prediction.
